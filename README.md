## **Computational Analysis of the Physical Properties of Water-in-Salt Electrolytes**
### Abstract
<div style="text-align: right"> One of the main causes of hazards in battery operation is dendrite growth at the anodes, which can lead to short circuits and battery fires when combined with flammable electrolytes. One potential solution to mitigate fire risks is replacing flammable electrolytes with non-flammable ionic liquids. Unfortunately, the high costs associated with these liquids make commercialization unfeasible. Aqueous electrolytes are a promising alternative as they offer both non-flammability and excellent transport properties.

To model Lithium-ion water-in-salt electrolytes (WISE) using classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we explore various force fields where atomic polarization is accounted for at two different levels: a non-polarizable all-atom force field where polarization is only implicitly included in its Van-der-Waals interaction parameters, and an explicit polarizable force field where polarization is models via Drude oscillators. We also probe combing different polarization levels for salt ions and water: when ion polarization is described by the Drude method, water is modelled by either the non-polarizable SPC/E model or the polarizable SWM4-NDP model. The objective is to maintain simulation stability for diverse force fields and analyze the impact of force fields on electrolyte features. In the present work, as a first step to reliably study the properties of WISE in Lithium-ion batteries, we have tested and compared various force fields, including:
(1) 21 m LiTFSI in H2O; 
(2) 21 m LiTFSI and 7 m LiOTf in H2O; 
(3) 12 m (LiTFSI/EMC, H2O); 
(4) 3.22 m (LiTFSI/NMA, H2O). 
Through a rigorous comparison of different force fields, we can accurately pinpoint the critical chemical and physical properties of electrolytes that are fundamental to the optimal functioning of Lithium-ion batteries. </div>
